# Project Technology Overview

## Frontend

- We use nextjs with type script for the front end
- In terms of styling, we use tailwind css and shadcn ui components

## Backend

- We use prisma that's connected to a postgresql database hosted on neondb
- There's no API as of now and all data fetching & manipulation is done with server actions in nextjs

## Authentication

- Authentication is handled using betterAuth with the google provider

# Code Guidelines

- When suggesting code, try to use the technologies mentioned above
- For example, when creating a button on the front end, try using the shadcn ui library's button instead of a native html button
